# ExpoHub Android

This is a simple client implementation used to demonstrate the required steps to communicate with the main ExpoHub Web's JSONApi.

**Disclaimer:** This app is part of the **ExpoHub** project, which is a thesis project used to demonstrate a client-server architecture development, and thus it should be considered to be in an **experimental phase**. The source containing the server-side implementation can be found here:

This project demonstrates the following concepts:
* Dependency injection via Dagger2 (https://google.github.io/dagger/).
* A simple implementation of the **Clean Architecture**, dividing all app logic inside layers.
* Adaptation to the JSONApi standard (using this library: https://github.com/kamikat/moshi-jsonapi).
* Implementation of material design concepts.
* MVP Pattern for the UI Layer.
